## Merkletools
Most of the code in this repository was copies and/or edited from [pymerkletools](https://github.com/Tierion/pymerkletools) under MIT licence.
This repository contains code needed to create merkle tries and merkle proofs.

IMPORTANT: This code is by no means secure, I am not a software developer or security specialist. If you see any security issues or want to improve the code, please create an issue or a pull-request if you know a good fix. If you have ideas for new functions you can also create a new issue. I do not garantie that I will solve the issues because this is a hobby project and I don't always have the time, but all help is welcome.

### Installation
The biggest chance for a stable library is using one of the releases on the releases branch. If there are no releases or none that fit you, try the nightly rleases or build your own wheel file. Watch out when using nightly releases, this branch is used for adding experimental functions and may not work as expected
